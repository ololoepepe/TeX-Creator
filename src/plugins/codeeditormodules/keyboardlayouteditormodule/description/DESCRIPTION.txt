Keyboard Layout Editor Module is a TeX Creator plugin, which adds keyboard
layout switching functionality to the editor.

If you typed some text using the wrong locale (eg. Russian instead of English)
the plugin will help you convert this text. Just select it and press <Ctrl+L>.

For example, "ыщьу еуче" will become "some text".
